Hi, I'm Bethany (she/her)! I am a first-year doctoral student at NYU Steinhardt in the [Communication Sciences and Disorders](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/departments/communicative-sciences-and-disorders) program. I work with [Si On Yoon](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/si-yoon) in the [CoMM Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/commlab/), studying the intersection between language and memory.



Research Interests
======
My current research interests include language neuroscience, psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and cognitive science. I aim to explore the neural basis of language and memory in conversation, specifically in older multilinguals and/or those with neurodegenerative diseases. 

(This section will be updated once I have begun my PhD research :) )



Background
======
I received a B.S. in Psychological and Brain Sciences and B.A.s in English and Linguistics (Speech-Language Sciences and Disorders) from UC Santa Barbara in 2024. While there, I worked with [Laurel Brehm](https://linguistics.ucsb.edu/people/laurel-brehm)’s PRPL Lab in the UCSB Linguistics department to complete my undergraduate thesis. This piece observed prosody-mediated language processing via eye-tracking in a visual-world paradigm, and is currently in review. (More info under my Research tab!) Now, I am following up on my thesis with a replication-extension in Cantonese-English bilinguals; this study was designed by myself and Lu Liu (UCSB, OSU).
