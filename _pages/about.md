Hi, I'm Bethany (she/her)! I am a first-year doctoral student at NYU Steinhardt in the [Communication Sciences and Disorders](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/departments/communicative-sciences-and-disorders) program. I work with [Si On Yoon](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/si-yoon) in the [CoMM Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/commlab/), studying the intersection between language and memory.



Research Interests
======
My current research interests include language neuroscience, psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and cognitive science. I aim to contribute to models of cognition, language, and memory in healthy older adults and specifically older adults with neurodegenerative diseases. My doctoral research will highlight memory for naturalistic interactions and will utilize a variety of methods, from behavioral/eye-tracking paradigms to EEG/ERP to computational methods.

This section will be updated once I begin my PhD research :)

Background
======
I received a B.S. in Psychological and Brain Sciences and B.A.s in English and Linguistics (Speech-Language Sciences and Disorders) from UC Santa Barbara in 2024. While there, I worked with [Laurel Brehm](https://linguistics.ucsb.edu/people/laurel-brehm)’s PRPL Lab in the UCSB Linguistics department to complete my undergraduate thesis. This piece observed prosody-mediated language processing via eye-tracking in a visual-world paradigm, and is currently in review. (More info under my Research tab!) Now, I am following up on my thesis with a replication-extension in Cantonese-English bilinguals; this study was designed by myself and Lu Liu (UCSB, OSU).
