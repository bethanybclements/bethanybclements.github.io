**General Member**
* As a general member of ASK, I volunteered for various charitable organizations, set up academic enrichment panels, and presented at our open-access research colloquiums

**Vice President of Operations** - 05.2023-05.2024
* As ASK's VP Ops, I had the opportunity to manage a Big-Little program for women and nonbinary students in STEM. It was a challenge to pair up students with common interests and mentorship aims within such a large student organization, but the process ultimately enriched our bonds and community 

**Professional Fraternity Council Representative** - 05.2023-05.2024
* As ASK's PFC Rep, I collaborated with other PFC representatives to host networking events and even a professional-clothing drive! 


## Toshin Global English Camp: Come on Out Japan (07.2022-08.2022)
* Serving as a coach in Come On Out Japan's 2022 English Camp allowed me to meet and cooperate with mentors from around the world as we instructed our teams (6-7 Japanese high-schoolers, solo and paired instruction) in developing a life mission presentation. We facilitated speech exercises and meaningful group discussions between coaches and ESL students


## UCSB Community Affairs Board (09.2020-06.2021)
* During my first year at UCSB, I worked with UCSB CAB's Family Literacy Program as a virtual tutor. I provided written/spoken English language instruction and reading practice for underprivileged students (and their parents), as well as homework help for the students
