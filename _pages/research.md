**Recognition Memory as a Function of Word Slot and Contrastive Accenting in the Visual World Paradigm** [in review]
* Examines the effects of prosodic prominence (via contrastive-pitch accenting) on language processing and memory (pitch accent-memory link established through eye-tracking in the VWP)

Ongoing Projects 
====
## Pitch Accenting, Bilingualism, and Recognition Memory
**UCSB Linguistics Dept.** - 10.2024-Present
* Expanded on literature regarding memory for contrastive-pitch accents through an eye-tracking study in  Cantonese-English bilinguals 
* Compiled a literature review on contrastive prosody acquisition and L1 transfer in L2 English-learners
* Will pinpoint the acoustic qualities used to learn English in L1 tonal language speakers via a model-fitting approach

## Pitch Accenting and Recognition Memory
**UCSB Linguistics Dept.** - 08.2023-Present
* Collaborated with professionals (Dr. Laurel Brehm; Dr. Scott Fraundorf) to expand foundational pitch accenting literature
* Collected, cleaned, and analyzed eye-tracking data to establish causal links between contrastive prosody, fixation-mediated attention, and recognition memory
* Developed a set of 240 stimuli to be used within the visual world paradigm

Lab Experience 
======
## UCSB Linguistics Dept.
**Production and Perception of Language (PRPL) Lab** - 08.2023-06.2025
* Coded and analyzed speech errors in sentence-completion output for 100+ participants
* Recruited and worked with children and adults for three different experiments on the development of emotion words (30h volunteer work)
* Instructed undergraduate RAs in the use of portable and stationary eye-tracking equipment
* Participated in a research initiative to utilize LLMs to enhance diversity in language science research

## UCSB Psychological and Brain Sciences Dept.
**Mayer Lab** - 04.2023-06.2024
* Spliced and organized audio files from 60+ participants using Shotcut (30h)
* Collaborated with native Mandarin speakers and opera singers to establish grading scales for musical pitch productions and second-language Mandarin utterances  
* Scored second-language Mandarin learners on pitch-accent replication and production of basic Pinyin and pitch contours (40h)
* Conducted statistical analyses on the correlation between musical pitch ability and success in replicating and producing pitch-contours in Mandarin


## UCSB English Dept. (Literature and Mind Program)
**Trauma-Informed Pedagogy Initiative** - 07.2023-12.2023
* Assembled a 94-page review summarizing the educational, political, and psychophysiological consequences of trigger warning implementation
* Prepared and gave a well-attended campus presentation and Q+A session on trigger warnings and trauma
* Led a discussion panel on the language and rhetoric of trigger warnings in education
